 bm_1262_antebellum_desc:0 "The North stands before a precipice.\n\nThough centuries of conquest have built strong kingdoms, their rulers waste blood and treasure over border posts and trifling slights. The Elder Folk – elves, dwarves, and their like – assimilate to the filth and lucre of human cities, or cling to the last remnants of their ancient claims. Yet the rage of the Elder Folk is all but boiling over, with some hearkening back to the old wars for freedom from human oppression. Monsters lurk in forgotten lairs, culled in witchers’ hunts, but never so few as humans would believe. Meanwhile, beyond the Amell Mountains, one kingdom after another falls beneath the banners of the Great Sun – of Nilfgaard and her inexorable imperator.\n\n#bold Will the North unite before crisis strikes?#!"

Since ascending to the throne in Tretogor, he has made amends with his father’s foes in the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and seized the Arc Coast for Redania. Vizimir trusts in his advisors, above all his brilliant court mage and ruthless spymaster. Yet Vizimir's enemies wait and watch in the court of Tretogor, while rival kingdoms man their borders and eye Redania's rich fiefs.\n\n#bold Can Vizimir keep his throne?#!"

 bookmark_antebellum_foltest_desc:0 "The greatest threat to the King of Temeria, a legend of the North in his own lifetime, is himself. Foltest's lust and arrogance led him to incest, a cursed heir, and the brink of war with Redania. Yet thanks to his wisdom and a certain Witcher, Foltest stands proud with his daughter restored and his realm united. Though border disputes threaten war with Redania and Aedirn, no monarch in the North would face Foltest on the battlefield.\n\n#bold Can Foltest rise above his flaws to lead?#!"

Her foes are fled or fallen before the Queen's loyal men at arms, while her friends hold court in Vizima and Vengerberg. Still, her legacy is far from secured: Meve's sons are young and feckless, and forces greater than the kingdoms of Dol Angra gather beyond the Yaruga. To survive the coming storm, Meve must guide her realm with the courage and guile of a legend.\n\n#bold Will Meve's reign echo through history?#!"

Bran has bound the islander clans together through generations of feasts, hunts, and raids, and even joined with the great kingdom of Cintra through the autumn romance of his brother Eist. Still, for all the wise king’s statecraft, his subjects remember their old feuds. The boldest of the jarls sharpen their blades and prepare for the treacherous days of Bran’s succession, while the druids of Gedyneith warn of a war coming to wash the islands in blood.\n\n#bold Can Bran secure the future of his realm?#!"

Soon enough, Calanthe's daughter was gone and her granddaughter was promised to the unholy Witcher. Now, a black storm gathers beyond the Marnadal Stairs, threatening all Calanthe holds dear. \n\n#bold Can Calanthe defeat Destiny and an empire?#!"
