 innovation_castle_baileys:0 "Castle Baileys"

 innovation_men-at-arms:0 "Men-at-Arms"
 innovation_men-at-arms_desc:0 "Those skilled in the horse and the lance will always be in demand, but are not always available. Keeping groups of men-at-arms on retainer will ensure that we do not lack experienced fighters when war inevitably breaks out."

 innovation_knighthood:0 "Knighthood"
 innovation_knighthood_desc:0 "By bestowing knighthoods upon our best fighters and paying them with land holdings instead of mere coin, we can give them the honor they deserve as well as secure their loyalty to us."

 innovation_scutage:0 "Scutage"

 innovation_guilds:0 "Guilds"
 innovation_guilds_desc:0 "As our lands expand it becomes increasingly inefficient to directly manage all trade going on within our domain. By granting guild charters to organizations of merchants and craftsmen we can give them more autonomy over their businesses while still ensuring we profit from their ventures."

 innovation_development_03:0 "Urbanization"
 innovation_development_03_desc:0 "The great cities of Rome, Byzantium, and Delhi have long stood out as relics of a great, unmatchable legacy. As our infrastructure and population grow, we finally have the means to develop new settlements which rival these ancient urban centers."
